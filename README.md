# 4_oop_game
A browser-based, word guessing game. The player tries to guess a random hidden phrase, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard. The player continues to select letters until they guess the phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose).

## Added keyboard functionality
Lets players use their physical computer keyboard to enter guesses.

## Style changes for extra credit:
- Start screen title: italics, pink
- Start button: larger, green, bold font, hover color
- Letter placeholder color: light yellow
- Main game screen: changed 'justify-content' to 'flex-start', so that the top of the game isn't cut off
